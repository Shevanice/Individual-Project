            <h2>My Personality</h2>
            <p>
                Here is a visual representation of my personality.  I enjoy taking selfies, driving, playing board games, watching animals, 
                observing nature, sleeping, watching movies, and lending a helping hand when needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                My strongest personality trait is my determination for success. My determination drives me to find practical solutions to 
                any problem I encounter, and I make it my mission to succeed in whatever I do. However, I am also an introvert who enjoys 
                solitude rather than being overly social and outgoing. As an introvert, I tend to be more of a listener than a talker, and 
                I am highly observant. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These traits positively impact my academic life, as they provide a sense of balance and motivation, especially during stressful 
                times. My hobbies keep me grounded and help me stay focused. Additionally, these characteristics contribute to my studies by 
                teaching me valuable life skills, such as problem-solving and adaptability—both of which are essential in the field of Information 
                Technology.  I feel a sense of fulfillment and confidence knowing that these qualities not only support my personal growth but 
                also drive my academic and professional success.

<!-- MOTTO SECTION -->

        <h2>My Motto</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>"My motto is "Do what what you have to do now, so you can rest later."</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This quote, stated by my dad, has stuck with me throughout my life. It has taught me the importance of working hard in the 
            present so I can enjoy peace later. Time is something that can never be regained, so it's essential to make the most of it. 
            By tackling what needs to be done now, I can rest without stressing over unfinished tasks. This mindset has made me more 
            productive and organized in my daily life. I’m grateful for this quote—it has shaped me into the person I strive to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose this quote from my dad because I look up to him as a role model. He has always been a hard worker and has instilled 
            the value of dedication in me. I admire his ability to balance work and family life while remaining committed to both. 
            Throughout my life, he has consistently been there for me, providing guidance and support. I am grateful for his wisdom 
            and the invaluable lessons he has taught me.

<!-- PERSONALITY TEST -->
    <section class="personality-test">
        <h2>My Personality Test Result</h2>
        <img src="/Assets/Screenshot 2025-02-03 084142.png" alt="Personality Test Result">
        <p>
            After completing the personality test, my results indicate that my strongest attributes are Thinking (100%), Interpersonal (80%), and Easygoing (83%). 
            These results suggest that I am highly analytical, preferring to plan and organize. I experience joy and fulfillment primarily through the happiness of 
            others, often prioritizing their needs over my own. Additionally, I value relaxation and peace over stress and chaos. My Offbeat (76%) score reflects 
            my preference for creativity and unconventional approaches to problem-solving. Meanwhile, my Sectarian (76%) score suggests that I strongly identify 
            with my groups and tend to be more cautious or less trusting of outsiders.
        </p>
        <p>
            My weakest personality traits are Materialistic (63%) and Vital (16%). The materialistic score indicates that, while I have some inclination toward 
            external validation, it is not a dominant trait. My low Vital (16%) score suggests that I have a low desire for physical activity and may not be 
            highly optimistic or energized in that aspect. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Reflecting on the test’s validity, I believe it accurately captures key aspects of my personality. While no test is entirely precise, the insights provided 
            align well with how I approach my studies and personal growth.
