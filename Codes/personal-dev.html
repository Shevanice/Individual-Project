                <h3>Chapter 4: Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Chapter 4 emphasizes the importance of goal setting, not just for the achievement itself but for the personal growth it 
                    fosters. Michael meets with Charlie, who teaches him that success starts with writing down goals and breaking them into 
                    actionable steps. Charlie shares wisdom from Mr. Davis, explaining that setting a goal forces a person to develop discipline, 
                    skills, and habits that make them more capable. The chapter highlights that while one cannot change their destination overnight, 
                    they can change their direction overnight meaning that the first step toward success is making a conscious choice to start.

                <p>
                    This chapter resonated with me because it reinforced the power of intentionality in shaping my future. 
                    The idea that who I become is more valuable than what I achieve also struck me. If I aim to earn a six-figure salary, the real reward
                    isn't just the money it's the skills, discipline, and mindset I develop in the process. The chapter's key lesson "You can’t change 
                    your destination overnight, but you can change your direction overnight" is motivating. I might not be an expert today, but by shifting
                    my daily actions and habits, I can gradually move closer to my goals. The first step? Writing them down and taking action.

                <h3>Chapter 5: Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    This chapter explores time management and the difference between urgent vs. important tasks. Michael tells Charlie he doesn’t have time to 
                    focus on his goals due to work, family, and responsibilities. In response, Charlie shares wisdom from Mr. Davis, stating that we all 
                    experience either the pain of discipline or the pain of regret, with regret being far heavier. He emphasizes that life moves quickly, and 
                    those who fail to pursue their dreams often wake up at the end of their lives filled with regret. Charlie explains that each day presents 
                    many opportunities, but only one best opportunity, which aligns with long-term goals. Most people fall into the trap of urgency, constantly 
                    reacting to immediate demands instead of focusing on what truly matters. He warns Michael that if he doesn’t design his life, someone else 
                    will and they won’t plan much for him. The lesson is clear: either you control your time, or time controls you. As Michael prepares to leave, 
                    his phone alerts him to another urgent but unimportant work matter. This moment reinforces the chapter’s message he is still caught in the 
                    cycle of reacting to distractions instead of focusing on what matters.

                <p>
                    This chapter hit me hard because I can relate to Michael’s struggle. As University student, I juggle coursework, projects, 
                    and personal responsibilities. There are always urgent tasks emails, assignments and deadlines. Charlie's lesson about spending time wisely made me 
                    realize that I need to prioritize what is important over what is simply urgent. The line “Either you run the day, or the day runs you” is a wake-up call. 
                    I don’t want to look back years from now realizing I spent too much time reacting instead of creating. Starting today, I’ll take control of my time because 
                    I’d rather endure the pain of discipline than the weight of regret.

                <h3>Chapter 6: Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    In Chapter 6, Charlie teaches Michael that the people we surround ourselves with greatly influence our success. He explains that to grow, 
                    we must evaluate our relationships and surround ourselves with positive, successful individuals who encourage us to be better. Negative 
                    associations can hinder our progress, so it's important to assess who we spend time with and whether they support our goals. Successful 
                    people tend to associate with other motivated individuals, and by working on ourselves, we can attract better relationships. Ultimately, 
                    the chapter stresses the importance of choosing associations wisely to foster personal growth.
                </p>
                <h4>Reflection</h4> 
                <p>
                    This chapter really struck me because it highlights how our relationships shape our future. The idea that we are the average of the five 
                    people we spend the most time with is a powerful reminder to be mindful of our inner circle. Negative associations, even small ones, can hold 
                    us back from reaching our full potential. It made me realize I need to evaluate my relationships more critically. Are they pushing me forward 
                    or keeping me stuck? I need to surround myself with people who support my growth and share similar goals. I also learned that to attract 
                    successful, motivated people, I need to invest in myself and raise my own level of success. Letting go of relationships that don’t serve 
                    me may be tough, but it’s necessary for growth. Life is a journey, and I want to spend it with people who help me become my best self.

                <h3>Chapter 7: Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    In this chapter, the focus is on the importance of continuous learning beyond formal education. Charlie explains that while formal education 
                    can help you make a living, self-education is what leads to success. He highlights that successful individuals never stop learning, and it’s
                    essential to grow by actively seeking knowledge through books, observing successful people, and reflecting on personal experiences. Charlie 
                    stresses the value of reading, even if Michael initially resists the idea, thinking it’s a waste of time and money. Charlie, however, 
                    argues that reading is one of the greatest learning tools available, exposing us to new ideas and expanding our worldview. He encourages 
                    Michael to read books, starting with a list of essential readings that could lead to personal and professional growth. By doing so, Michael 
                    will continue to learn and improve, furthering his journey toward success.

                <p>
                    This chapter made me realize that learning doesn’t end with a degree. True success comes from constantly educating ourselves throughout life. 
                    The idea that self-education shapes our fortunes is powerful, and it made me reflect on the importance of self-growth. I now see that reading 
                    is crucial for expanding my knowledge and improving my life. Although I’m not always keen on reading, I understand that it’s a gateway to new 
                    ideas and success. I also appreciate how learning from others’ experiences and reflecting on my own is key to growth. This chapter motivates 
                    me to take responsibility for my education and keep learning, not just through formal channels but in every aspect of life.
